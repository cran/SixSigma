\title{Confidence Interval for the mean}
\usage{
ss.ci(
  x,
  sigma2 = NA,
  alpha = 0.05,
  data = NA,
  xname = "x",
  approx.z = FALSE,
  main = "Confidence Interval for the Mean",
  digits = 3,
  sub = "",
  ss.col = c("#666666", "#BBBBBB", "#CCCCCC", "#DDDDDD", "#EEEEEE")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector with the variable data}

\item{sigma2}{The population variance, if known}

\item{alpha}{The eqn{\\alpha} error used to compute the \eqn{100*(1-\\alpha)\%} confidence interval}

\item{data}{The data frame containing the vector}

\item{xname}{The name of the variable to be shown in the graph}

\item{approx.z}{If TRUE it uses z statistic instead of t when sigma is unknown and sample size 
is greater than 30. The default is FALSE, change only if you want to compare with
results obtained with the old-fashioned method mentioned in some books.}

\item{main}{The main title for the graph}

\item{digits}{Significant digits for output}

\item{sub}{The subtitle for the graph (recommended: six sigma project name)}

\item{ss.col}{A vector with colors}
}
\value{
The confidence Interval.\cr
  A graph with the figures, the Shapiro-Wilks test,  and a histogram.
}
\description{
Computes a confidence interval for the mean of the variable (parameter
or feature of the process), and prints the data, a histogram with a density line,
the result of the Shapiro-Wilks normality test and a quantile-quantile plot.
}
\details{
When the population variance is known, or the size is greater than 30,
it uses z statistic. Otherwise, it is uses t statistic.\cr
If the sample size is lower than 30, a warning is displayed so as to
verify normality.

Thanks to the kind comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewer 
of a tentative article.
